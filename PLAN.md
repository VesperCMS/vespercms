# PLAN.md

The working plan: where each phase stands, the design of the next phase, and the roadmap. Scope and decisions come from `vesper-spec.md`. This file records how we intend to build them, and it changes as phases land. Reasons for choices live in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Phase status

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 0 Scaffold | Built and verified locally (2026-10-17). Done once CI is green on GitHub. |
| 1 Core | Designed below, not started |
| 2 onward | Roadmap below |

## Phase 0: Scaffold

The deliverables are listed in spec §11 Phase 0, plus addendum §7's playground additions. Phase 0 is done when:

- CI is green.
- The playground builds as static output with no adapter.
- The contrast check and the Playwright and axe e2e suite pass.
- `npm run dev` serves the playground.
- Typecheck, lint and tests pass.
- Each package has a README.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `DECISIONS.md` are current.

Two parts of the playground wait for their phase:

- `<Form>` arrives in Phase 6. `src/forms.config.ts` holds the contact form's definition in raw Zod until then.
- `<Search />` arrives in Phase 2.9. The header reserves its slot until then.

## Phase 1: Core (design)

**Module layout.**
- `packages/core/src`:
  - `schema/`: the Zod 4 walker (structural, no zod import).
  - `widgets/`: inference and resolution.
  - `manifest/`: types, a pure builder, and a SHA-256 hash via Web Crypto.
  - `collections/`: glob matching and Astro-identical IDs.
  - `files/`: text codec, frontmatter split, value diff to patches, YAML read/locate/edit, JSON edit, write verification.
  - `storage/`: the interface, git blob SHA, a memory adapter, and a contract suite that takes the test framework as a parameter.
- `packages/astro/src`:
  - `fields/`: the nine helpers, importing only `astro/zod`. `fields.image` waits for Phase 2.7.
  - `config/`: `defineConfig`, which accepts the documented keys including addendum ones such as `schedule` and `search`, and warns on unknown keys.
  - `node/`: config loading, introspection, manifest writing and the local fs adapter.
  - `cli.ts`: `vesper manifest`.

**Loading the site's configs.**
- Use the site's own Vite, in an isolated `createServer`, and import through `environments.ssr.runner.import()`.
- A pre-enforced shim plugin handles the Astro modules:
  - `astro:content` re-exports Astro's real `defineCollection` and `createReference` from `astro/content/runtime`, plus `z`. Runtime-only functions throw.
  - `astro/loaders` is wrapped so the real `glob()` and `file()` still run, with their options attached under a symbol.
  - Any other `astro:*` module makes the collection read-only with a plain message.
- Function schemas are called with a marked `image`.
- A contract test per Astro major checks that the shim's exports are a superset of `templates/content/module.mjs`. It runs against Astro 7 at the root and against `fixtures/astro6-site`.
- The same loader later reads `vesper.config.ts`, `markdoc.config.mjs` and `forms.config.ts`.
- Validation always uses the user's real Zod objects.

**The walker.**
- Peel `optional`, `nullable`, `default`, `prefault`, `catch`, `readonly` and `lazy`, merging `.meta()` from inner to outer so the outermost layer wins.
- Detect image by its marker. Detect `reference` with a behavioural probe (`safeParse('x')` returns `{id, collection}`), which works on Astro 6 and 7 even though their union shapes differ.
- Map types per the §6.2 table and extract constraints.
- Refinements keep their base kind (in Zod 4 they are checks). Transforms, unions, records and tuples become `unknown`, shown as raw YAML.
- It never throws: each field is wrapped in try/catch and failures become diagnostics.

**Widget resolution.**
- Runs at manifest build, in Node, where the `match` and `accepts` functions from `vesper.config.ts` can be called.
- The manifest stores both the resolved and the inferred widget, plus warnings. The browser only looks components up by name.

**Manifest.**
- Versioned and deterministic: POSIX paths, no timestamps.
- Includes collections (source, editable or read-only with a reason, fields, presentation), forms, and diagnostics.
- Phase 1 emits it from the CLI. Phase 2 adds `astro sync` and `dist/_vesper/manifest.json`.

**Serializers.**
- Split frontmatter with Astro's exact regex, keeping BOM and EOL.
- Read values with js-yaml.
- Locate nodes with `yaml` (`keepSourceTokens`), but only when it parses with no errors and its values deep-equal js-yaml's. Otherwise the block is source-only.
- **Splice minimal edits into the original text:**
  - scalars keep their style;
  - dates keep their shape and offset;
  - added and deleted keys are line-based;
  - each line keeps its own line ending.
- The Document API is a flagged fallback, used only for anchors, aliases and tags.
- Every write is re-read and deep-compared before it is stored.
- JSON is edited with `jsonc-parser` `modify`/`applyEdits`.
- `file()` entries are located by id at write time.
- A no-op save returns the original bytes. TOML is read-only in v1.

**Storage adapter.**
- Methods: `head`, `list`, `read`, and `commit(ChangeSet)`, where a ChangeSet holds `put`, `delete` and `move` changes with `expectedVersion`.
- `version` is the git blob SHA-1, so memory, local, GitHub and cloud adapters all agree, and Phase 4's `base_sha` works unchanged.

**Dependencies, each with its reason:**
- `js-yaml`: Astro's own parser.
- `yaml`: the lossless CST.
- `jsonc-parser`: formatting-preserving JSON edits.
- `github-slugger`: ID parity with Astro.
- `picomatch`: the matcher Astro uses.

**Tests mapped to the "Done when" criteria:**
- **Manifest snapshots** for every playground collection and the Astro 6 fixture, cross-checked against `.astro/data-store.json`.
- **Corpus:** `sources.json` records repo, commit and path for files from Jeremy's three own sites, about 120 in total (well over 30), plus synthetic gaps: JSON indents, anchors, BOM, TOML, MDX imports, CRLF and mixed EOL. `VESPER_PRIVATE_CORPUS` adds the client sites, locally only.
- **"No unrelated diff"** has two parts:
  - a no-op save is byte-identical;
  - editing path P changes only P's byte range, keeps untouched lines' EOLs, and re-reads to the expected value.
- **Raw-field fallbacks:** a table of unmappable schema types, each expected to fall back.
- **Meta placement:** every wrapper order and every meta position produces the same field model.
- **Widgets:** an unknown widget, or one whose `accepts` rejects the field, falls back with a warning that names the field and the widget.

**Commits, in order:**
1. Corpus and import script.
2. Text codec and frontmatter split.
3. YAML reader and locator with the parity gate.
4. Value diff to patches.
5. YAML splice editor.
6. YAML Document fallback and write verification.
7. JSON editor.
8. Entry and data-file serializers.
9. Storage interface, memory adapter and contract suite.
10. Walker.
11. Image and reference detection.
12. Widgets.
13. Glob matching and IDs.
14. Manifest.
15. `@vesper/astro` with the `fields` helpers.
16. Isolated Vite loader with shims and fixtures.
17. `defineConfig`.
18. Manifest CLI and snapshots.
19. Local fs adapter.
20. Playground adopts the helpers and `vesper.config.ts`.

| 9 Polish | §13.5 | per spec |

## Risks and early spikes
- **S0:** the source-condition dev loop on Windows (Phase 0). Fallback: tsc watch.
- **Astro internals drift.** Mitigation: use only public exports, plus a shim contract test per major.
- **The `@vesper` npm scope may be taken (§13.1).** Packages stay private and unpublished through Phase 1, so a rename then is cheap. Check availability before the first publish.
- **Sample-file licensing.** Only CC0, public-domain or MIT-compatible files, with provenance recorded in the README.
